# Enterprise GenAI Knowledge Assistant (AWS)

## Overview
This project implements a secure, enterprise-grade Generative AI knowledge assistant using AWS services.  
It leverages Amazon Bedrock and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, auditable, and context-aware responses from proprietary knowledge sources.

### Business Problem

- Data leakage
- Hallucinations
- Lack of governance
- Compliance risks

## Solution
A cloud-native GenAI assistant that:
- Uses Amazon Bedrock foundation models
- Grounds responses using enterprise documents (RAG)
- Enforces security, IAM, and auditability
- Is production-ready and interview-defensible
